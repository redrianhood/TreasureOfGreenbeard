As you look around you see that your crew has all survived and
stand amidst a pile of bones from the defeated skeletons. Those
not yet defeated fall, as if the magic of Greenbeard keeping them
alive is no longer.

It takes a few trips, but your crew is able to load all of Greenbeard's
treasure in the ship. Sailing away from Yarginory Island, your crew
sings the praises of their great Captain.

With enough treasure to last a good long while, you all talk about
plans for after returning to port. Your crew wants to stay on, so
it begs the question...

What adventure will you and your crew begin next?
